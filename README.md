# BCG-Data-Science-Analytics
Virtual Experience Program


As a BCG GAMMA Data Scientist, I worked on a project with PowerCo, a major utilities company, to reduce customer churn within their SME customers. This project will provide me with the opportunity to work in various industries and tackle different business challenges. The skills that I developed and used as a consultant and data scientist will be applicable to a wide range of cases. Overall, this project gave me a valuable experience in applying data science and advanced analytics to drive business impact.




I conducted an exploratory data analysis on the client's historical customer and pricing data to understand the relationship between price sensitivity and customer churn. Also calculated the price sensitivity index as the ratio of average variable price to average fixed price and found a weak negative correlation of -0.0291 between price sensitivity and churn. This suggests that price sensitivity may not be the largest driver of churn in the given dataset. To further enhance the analysis,  proposed collecting additional data, such as demographic information, customer satisfaction data, competitor pricing, seasonal consumption patterns, customer interactions, and open-source datasets related to energy consumption and customer behavior. These additional data sources can help improve the accuracy of the churn model and provide deeper insights into factors contributing to customer churn.
