# BCG-Data-Science-Analytics
Virtual Experience Program


As a BCG GAMMA Data Scientist, I worked on a project with PowerCo, a major utilities company, to reduce customer churn within their SME customers. This project will provide me with the opportunity to work in various industries and tackle different business challenges. The skills that I developed and used as a consultant and data scientist will be applicable to a wide range of cases. Overall, this project gave me a valuable experience in applying data science and advanced analytics to drive business impact.
